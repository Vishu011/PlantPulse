PlantPulse üå±
Welcome to PlantPulse ‚Äì an innovative ML and DL-powered platform designed to support precision agriculture by offering recommendations on crop selection, fertilizer usage, and plant disease management. This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for farmers to enhance their agricultural practices using cutting-edge technology.

üöÄ Overview
PlantPulse leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to offer valuable insights and recommendations for modern farming. The platform includes three main applications:

Crop Recommendation: Helps users choose the optimal crop based on soil data.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests the best fertilizers and soil amendments based on the type of crop and current soil conditions.
Plant Disease Prediction: Identifies plant diseases from images of diseased leaves and provides information on possible treatments.
üí° Motivation
Agriculture is a cornerstone of many economies, particularly in countries like India, where a significant portion of the population relies on farming for their livelihood. As new technologies such as ML and DL are integrated into agriculture, they offer promising solutions for optimizing crop yield and farming efficiency. PlantPulse is designed to showcase how these technologies can be applied to make farming more precise and data-driven.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
1. Crop Recommendation
Functionality: Users can input soil data (e.g., pH, nutrient levels) into the system.
Output: The application predicts the most suitable crops to grow based on the provided soil conditions.
2. Fertilizer Recommendation
Functionality: Users can enter information about their soil and the type of crop they are growing.
Output: The system analyzes the soil data to recommend necessary fertilizers and soil amendments to improve crop health and yield.
3. Plant Disease Prediction
Functionality: Users upload images of diseased plant leaves.
Output: The application identifies the disease, provides information about it, and suggests possible treatments or preventive measures.
‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
PlantPulse is a Proof of Concept (POC) and is intended for demonstration purposes only. The data used in this project is provided without any guarantee from the creator. Do not use this tool for making real-world farming decisions. The creator is not responsible for any outcomes resulting from the use of this application. However, the project illustrates the potential applications of ML and DL in precision farming when developed on a larger scale with verified data.
